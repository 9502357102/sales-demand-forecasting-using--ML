# Sales and Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning

This project predicts sales trends and product demand using machine learning models trained on Walmart sales data. It helps in understanding sales patterns, optimizing stock, and improving decision-making.

Step 2 Project Highlights

- Dataset: Walmart Sales Data (`walmart_sales_data.csv`)
- Platform: Google Colab (no local setup required)
- Techniques: Regression modeling, data preprocessing, and forecasting
- Visualizations: Matplotlib for trend and prediction plots

## Features

- Cleaned and processed historical sales data
- Feature selection and model training using Linear Regression
- Evaluation using RMSE and visualization of predictions
- Google Colab integration for easy access and execution

## Technologies Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- GitHub (version control and code sharing)
